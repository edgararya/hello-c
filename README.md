# Hello C 👋

Welcome to **Hello C**! 

This repository serves as a personal archive for my C programming studies. Here, I document my progress, code exercises, and mini-projects as I learn the language from scratch.

## 📚 Topics Covered
I have organized my learning path into several key categories:

- [x] **Basics** (Syntax, Comments, Output)
- [ ] **Variables & Data Types** (Integers, Floats, Chars)
- [ ] **Operators** (Arithmetic, Logical, Bitwise)
- [ ] **Control Flow** (If-Else, Switch Case)
- [ ] **Loops** (For, While, Do-While)
- [ ] **Functions** (Parameters, Return Values, Recursion)
- [ ] **Arrays & Strings** (1D/2D Arrays, String Manipulation)
- [ ] **Pointers & Memory** (References, Dereferencing, Dynamic Memory)
- [ ] **Structures** (Structs, Enums)
- [ ] **File Handling** (Read/Write Operations)

## 🚀 How to Run
Ensure you have a GCC compiler installed (like MinGW for Windows or build-essential for Linux).

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/hello-c.git](https://github.com/your-username/hello-c.git)
