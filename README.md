# Hello C 👋

Welcome to **Hello C**!

This repository serves as a personal archive for my C programming studies. Here, I document my progress, code exercises, and mini-projects as I learn the language from scratch.

## 📚 Syllabus & Topics Covered
All materials in this repository cover the following concepts:

### 1. The Fundamentals
* **Basics**: Comments, Escape Sequences.
* **Variables**: Data Types (int, float, char), Format Specifiers, Constants.
* **Operators**: Arithmetic, Augmented Assignment, Logical (AND, OR, NOT).

### 2. Input & Logic
* **User Input**: Using `scanf()` and `fgets()`.
* **Math Functions**: Square root, power, round, etc.
* **Control Flow**: If statements, Switch statements.
* **Loops**: For loops, While loops, Do-While loops, Nested loops.

### 3. Modular Programming
* **Functions**: Arguments, Return statements, Ternary operator.
* **Function Prototypes**: Declaration vs Definition.
* **String Handling**: String functions and methods.

### 4. Data Structures
* **Arrays**: 1D Arrays, 2D Arrays, Iterating through arrays.
* **Array of Strings**: Managing lists of text.
* **Sorting**: Bubble sort implementation.
* **Structs & Enums**: Creating custom data types using `struct` and `typedef`.

### 5. Advanced Concepts
* **Memory**: Understanding Memory Addresses.
* **Pointers**: Working with pointers and references.
* **Bitwise Operators**: Low-level bit manipulation.
* **File Handling**: Writing to and reading from files.
